# Resources

List of resources.
This is not formatted as an awesome list since it's mostly for myself and covers a combination of topics:

* [Art](art/README.md)
* [Audio](audio/README.md)
* [Code](code/README.md)
* [Math](math/README.md)

Of course these topics overlap in many ways, but I'll list resources where it seems the most relevant.
Lists for [Books] and [Podcasts] are separate.
